# DCGAN Demo

In this demo, we train a DCGAN using a huamn face dataset,
[CelebA dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html), and use the
train model to synthesize human faces.

The following animation shows fake faces synthesized using the GoTorch version
(left) and the PyTorch counterpart (right).

## Prepare the Data

From the Web page [CelebA
dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html), we can choose to
download the ZIP archive `img_align_celeba.zip` from Googel Drive or Baidu
Drive.

The following command unzip the archive and creates a tarball `train.tgz` of the
images shuffled in a random order.

```bash
unzip img_align_celeba.zip
tar czf train.tgz img_align_celeba
```

NOTE: If you work on macOS, you must install GNU tar.  Go's standard package
doesn't recognize macOS's BSD tar format.

```bash
brew install gnu-tar  # Use gtar instead tar in the above command.
```

## Build the Sample

Please follow the
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/wangkuiyi/gotorch/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md)
guide to build.

```bash
go install ./...
```

The `dcgan` binary will be installed at `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

## Run the Sample

The following command runs the sample program.

```bash
$GOPATH/bin/dcgan -dataroot=$DATAROOT/train.tgz
```

The training program periodically generates image samples and saves to pickle
files.  We provide a script to transform the saved pickle files into PNG format.

```bash
python visualize_pickle.py --load_gotorch=1 --save_image=1
```

And the script could also generate an animation to visualize
the training progress of generated fake images.
`ffmpeg` is needed to save the animation to mp4 format.

```bash
python visualize_pickle.py --load_gotorch=1 --save_video=1
```

To see the training loss curve:

```bash
python plot_loss.py --load_gotorch=1
```
