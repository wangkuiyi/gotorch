# GoTorch, in particular, gotorch/vision/transforms, uses OpenCV for
# image data augmentation. In Travis CI macOS VMs, we need to install
# OpenCV and its many dependencies. The updating of Homebrew and
# installation of OpenCV would take about 20 minutes. To shrink the
# time cost, we make Travis CI to cache the /usr/local directory,
# where Homebrew installs software packages.
