GoTorch reimplements PyTorch high-level APIs, including modules and functionals,
in idiomatic Go.  Thus enables deep learning programming in Go and Go+.  This
project is in its very early stage.

## Easy Switch

Writing deep learning systems in Go is as efficiently as in Python.  The DCGAN
training programs in
[GoTorch](https://github.com/wangkuiyi/gotorch/blob/develop/example/dcgan/dcgan.go)
and
[PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/4b119d735b802453479d739bf823f3f7d8d5d422/dcgan/main.py#L113-L273)
call similar APIs, have similar program structure, and have a similar number of
lines.  Go+ has a syntax similar to Python.  The Go+ compiler translates Go+
programs into Go source programs.  It is a joy to write Go+ programs that calls
Go packages like GoTorch.

We have a plan of a translator that migrates existing PyTorch models in Python
into GoTorch.

## Benefits

1. **Higher runtime efficiency**.  Go programs run as efficiently as C++.

1. **Training and prediction in the same language.** No longer training in
   Python and online prediction in C++.  All in Go/Go+.  No TensorFlow graphs or
   PyTorch tracing.

1. **Same data processing code for training and prediction.** No need to Wrap
   OpenCV functions into TensorFlow operators in C++ for prediction and Python
   for training.

1. **Supports many machine learning paradigms.**, including adversarial,
   reinforcement, and imitation learning -- those we cannot split into training
   and prediction.

1. **Same program for edge and cloud.** GoTorch programs compile and run on
   phones and self-driving cars as they do on servers and desktops.

## The Tech Stack

GoTorch works with the following open-source communities to form Go+Torch.

- the [Go+](https://github.com/goplus/gop) community,
- the PyTorch community, and
- the TenosrFlow XLA ecosystem.

The following figure reveals the stack of technologies.
